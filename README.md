How it works:
I download the Mien Bible from http://www.thaibible.or.th/mienbible/
the whole bible was downloaded one chapter at a time and each chapter was saved in a html file.
All this program does is let you choose using dropdown which chapter of which books you want to open, which is basically which html file you want to open, that's it.
